# Beat Sheet Calculator (for novels and short stories)

TBD - what, why, how?

The beat sheet is based on the original [Blake Snyder beat sheet][bs2] from his book [Save The Cat!][sc] but also includes additions from [Save The Cat! Strikes Back][scsb]. To better suit novels and short stories the first act is a bit shorter, based on input from [Plot & Stucture (James Scott Bell)][ps] since a written text demands more involvement from the reader than a movie that you can just sit back and watch.

Compared to the orignal beat sheet the following are modifications are made:

  * The length of act 1 is 1/5 of the total length.
  * The statis=death beat is added.
  * The five-point finale beats are added.
